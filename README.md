# Python KeyLogger
This is a small windows keylogger I made using this tutorial : https://www.askpython.com/python/examples/python-keylogger
Not really hard to do but useful if you don't know how to do it.
All the explanations are on the website

# Run
You have two options to run this software :
1. In a terminal, type "pip3 install .\dependencies.txt" then "python3 ".\klg.py" (useful for testing modifications)
2. Rename the file "klg.pyw" and double click it (to hide the terminal)
